This will collect the stock market data and create a table showing long term growth stocks by year.
It will by ranked as if each is a binary number.  Positive years is a one, negative years is a zero.
Most resent years will be the higher order bits and years in the past will be in the lower order bits.
This will create a binary number and the higher numbers are better.
